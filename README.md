# nginkc-go

A simple HTTP server in Go. Just made for fun and my own learning. Inspired by [build your own x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x).

So far:
Can accept HTTP 1.1 requests, parse them, pass them on to app, and return the app's response over the same connection.

To do:
- Add support for later HTTP versions
- Maybe setup a web framework or something else more interesting for the app
